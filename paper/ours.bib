abstract="Making evolutionary algorithms greener implies tackling implementation issues from different angles. Practitioners need to focus on those that can be more easily leveraged, such as the choice of the language that is going to be used; high-level (interpreted), mid-level (based on multi-platform virtual machines), and low-level (native) languages will need power in different ways, and choosing one or the other will have an impact on energy consumption. We will be looking at the implementation of key evolutionary algorithm functions, in three languages at three different levels: the high-level JavaScript, the mid-level Kotlin, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and the low-level Zig. Looking beyond the obvious, as the lower the level, the less energy consumption should be expected, we will try to have a more holistic view of the implementation of the algorithms in order to extract best practices regarding its green implementation.",

abstract = {The most fruitful way of making evolutionary algorithms
spend the least amount of energy is to consider all possible program-
ming techniques and platform choices that could, theoretically, affect
performance, and carry out experiments using EA workloads in different
platforms, eventually choosing those techniques that yield the minimum
amount of energy expenses. These techniques include a choice of differ-
ent data structures, as well as affecting compilation in such a way that
energy footprint is reduced; they have to be replicated in different com-
puting platforms because these expenditures may be affected by all the
layers of the operating system and runtime framework used. In this paper
we will experiment with different data structures and code refactoring
techniques in the low-level language zig, trying to design rules of thumb
that will help developers create green evolutionary algorithms. We will
include two different hardware platforms, looking for the one that spends
the least energy.},

In the case of evolutionary computation, we are talking about a specific workload that includes the generation of chromosomes and operations that change parts of them or access and operate on them to obtain a fitness value. In a low-level language such as Zig, we will show how different choices will affect the energy consumption of an experiment.},

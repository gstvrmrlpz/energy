abstract = {The most fruitful way of making evolutionary algorithms
spend the least amount of energy is to consider all possible program-
ming techniques and platform choices that could, theoretically, affect
performance, and carry out experiments using EA workloads in different
platforms, eventually choosing those techniques that yield the minimum
amount of energy expenses. These techniques include a choice of differ-
ent data structures, as well as affecting compilation in such a way that
energy footprint is reduced; they have to be replicated in different com-
puting platforms because these expenditures may be affected by all the
layers of the operating system and runtime framework used. In this paper
we will experiment with different data structures and code refactoring
techniques in the low-level language zig, trying to design rules of thumb
that will help developers create green evolutionary algorithms. We will
include two different hardware platforms, looking for the one that spends
the least energy.},

abstract = {Managing energy resources in scientific computing implies awareness of a wide range of software engineering techniques that, when applied, can minimize the energy footprint of experiments. In the case of evolutionary computation, we are talking about a specific workload that includes the generation of chromosomes and operations that change parts of them or access and operate on them to obtain a fitness value. In a low-level language such as Zig, we will show how different choices will affect the energy consumption of an experiment.},
